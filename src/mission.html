        What is NYC Watch?
    </h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        NYC Watch is this city's true neighborhood watch program. Whether you need protection or want to join and protect others. What is a neighborhood watch? It is something that fights the isolation that crime both creates and feeds upon. It forges bonds among area residents, helps reduce burglaries and robberies, and improves relations between police and the communities they server. 
        It works. Throughout the country, dramatic decreases in burglary and related offenses are reported by law enforcement professionals in communities with active Watch Programs
        Todayâ€™s transient society produces communities that are less personal.
        How Does a Neighborhood Watch Start?
        <br>
        <br>
        A motivated individual, a few concerned residents, a community organization, or a law enforcement agency can spearhead the efforts to establish a Watch. Together they can:
        Organize a small planning committee of neighbors to discuss needs, the level of interest, and the possible community problems.
        Contact NYC Watch for help in training members in home security and reporting skills and for information on local crime patterns.
        We will establish the purpose of the program; and begin to identify issues that need to be addressed.
        <br>
        <br>
        What can you do by yourself? Try to organize your own watch, your own leaders. Ask for block captain volunteers who are responsible for relaying information to the members.
        Recruit members, keeping up-to-date information on new residents and making special efforts to involve the elderly, working parents, and young people.
        Work with local government or law enforcement to put up Neighborhood Watch signs.
